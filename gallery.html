                <p id="sub1">
                    Orangeism is increasingly popular in South East England because people there are feeling somewhat “bereft” of their own culture, a local Orangeman says.
                    Peter Williamson, who is originally from Castlederg but now lives in Horsham in West Sussex, was not a member of the order until he moved to England 12 years ago.
                   However, a chance encounter with an English Orangeman led to him joining a lodge and he is now the Worshipful Master of lodge No 848, Sussex Crown Defenders.

                    Dave Loggins was a country singer and songwriter. He died aged 76 on Wednesday in Nashville in hospice care.
                    Born and raised in Tennessee, Dave was “one of the state's most notable songwriters,” says American celebrity news website TMZ. He wrote hits for Johnny Cash, Toby Keith, Alabama, Wynonna Judd, Reba McEntire, Willie Nelson, Kenny Rogers, Ray Charles, Smokey Robinson, and Three Dog Night.

                    Crowds of onlookers watched the large bonfire blazing in the loyalist Sandy Row.
                    Many tourists were among those observing the tall structure being set alight just after midnight.
                    Meanwhile, there was a party atmosphere towards the Sandy Row end of the site, where a disco was blaring music. Many young people were gathered around, drinking and watching the flames.

I was part of a group of guests invited by Fáilte Ireland, the national tourism development authority, www.failteireland.ie and Tourism Ireland www.tourismireland.com for a three-day visit in April to help celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Wild Atlantic Way.

                    Netflix has announced the exact release date of season 1 of 'Love Is Blind UK', which will be presented by Matt and Emma Willis.
                    Back in March, the streamer revealed that the series would be airing on the platform in the month of August - but since then fans have been waiting for news of the precise air date.
                    The date was finally released in a teaser trailer uploaded to the Netflix YouTube account earlier today (Thursday July 11). The clip shows Emma and Matt sharing a packet of crisps on a train, when a woman is heard shouting from the toilet.

                    The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government in its latest avatar of coalition politics, after the regime of former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee from 1998 to 2004, is different in one way — there is no talk of a common minimum programme on the table yet. Nor is there a clear move towards the appointment of an NDA convener as of now.

                    The NDA as an entity has continued even after the Vajpayee years, even though the BJP between 2014 and 2024 had a complete majority on its own. In the third term of Prime Minister Narendra Modi,</p>

Six MLAs of the Congress are believed to have cross-voted in favour of the ruling alliance, while the claims of leaders from the Sharad-Pawar led NCP faction that legislators from the Ajit Pawar camp were shifting towards them have been belied</p>

                    Through the history of the England football team, no two words have struck more fear than penalty shootout.

                    Of the 11 shootouts the men’s team has been part of at major tournaments, they’ve won only four. From the 1990 World Cup semifinal to the last Euros Final at home, the scarring memories have added to the emotional baggage of some of the most star-studded England teams. In the aftermath of losses, words such as ‘hoodoo’ and ‘lottery’ have been used by pundits and players alike, terming the shootout as an uncontrollable aspect of the game. England manager Gareth Southgate however, recently emphasized that it is anything but.</p>

                    It was never going to be a cruise, but Lakshya Sen’s path to an Olympic medal, looks full of barnacles – those sea creature colonies that cling to a ship and drag down its speed. There are only high hurdles at each step before Sen could get onto the Paris podium – and that might not necessarily be a bad thing for the Indian who revels in treacherous challenges on the biggest stages.

                    He is slotted in one of the two groups out of 13 that has 4 shuttlers. The other 11 pools have 3 players, where there will be one fewer match each. Sen has to get past Indonesian nemesis Jonatan Christie from that loaded Group L, which also has Tokyo surprise semifinalist Kevin Cordon, who came from Guatemala and disrupted the last Olympics.</p>

                    t’s Carlos Alcaraz vs Novak Djokovic on the final Sunday of the Wimbledon once again. Last time Djokovic tried but failed to win the title or the hearts of the fans. He gave his best, played his part in making it an epic, said the right things after the loss and even shed tears. Still it wasn’t enough to win over the strawberry-cream consuming regulars.

There was one touching moment from that match. It was when Djokovic got the microphone in hand. “I have to move on and be stronger hopefully,” he said just before his eyes fell on his eight-year-old son Stefan in the box. “My son, he is still smiling.” he said and he broke down. “I love you … thank you for supporting me .. I will give you a big hug.” It was actually the father who needed the hug. </p>
