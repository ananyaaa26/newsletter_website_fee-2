                <p id="sub1">
                    Orangeism is increasingly popular in South East England because people there are feeling somewhat “bereft” of their own culture, a local Orangeman says.
                    Peter Williamson, who is originally from Castlederg but now lives in Horsham in West Sussex, was not a member of the order until he moved to England 12 years ago.
                   However, a chance encounter with an English Orangeman led to him joining a lodge and he is now the Worshipful Master of lodge No 848, Sussex Crown Defenders.

                    Dave Loggins was a country singer and songwriter. He died aged 76 on Wednesday in Nashville in hospice care.
                    Born and raised in Tennessee, Dave was “one of the state's most notable songwriters,” says American celebrity news website TMZ. He wrote hits for Johnny Cash, Toby Keith, Alabama, Wynonna Judd, Reba McEntire, Willie Nelson, Kenny Rogers, Ray Charles, Smokey Robinson, and Three Dog Night.

                    Crowds of onlookers watched the large bonfire blazing in the loyalist Sandy Row.
                    Many tourists were among those observing the tall structure being set alight just after midnight.
                    Meanwhile, there was a party atmosphere towards the Sandy Row end of the site, where a disco was blaring music. Many young people were gathered around, drinking and watching the flames.

                <p id="sub4">
                    Last time I visited Ireland to play golf was more than 20 years ago. But after such a memorable trip to County Mayo and County Sligo, I’m sure it won’t be so long before I return. I was part of a group of guests invited by Fáilte Ireland, the national tourism development authority, www.failteireland.ie and Tourism Ireland www.tourismireland.com for a three-day visit in April to help celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Wild Atlantic Way.

                    Netflix has announced the exact release date of season 1 of 'Love Is Blind UK', which will be presented by Matt and Emma Willis.
                    Back in March, the streamer revealed that the series would be airing on the platform in the month of August - but since then fans have been waiting for news of the precise air date.
                    The date was finally released in a teaser trailer uploaded to the Netflix YouTube account earlier today (Thursday July 11). The clip shows Emma and Matt sharing a packet of crisps on a train, when a woman is heard shouting from the toilet.
